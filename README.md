# An E-Commerce Mobile Application for Electronic Gadgets & Appliances

## Unit Project Brief Description 
Problem the Project is Solving 
In today’s market, customers face fragmented product information, inconsistent pricing, and 
lack of real-time availability when shopping for electronic products across multiple stores. 
Small-to-medium electronics retailers struggle to compete with large e-commerce platforms 
due to limited digital presence. 
PromoHub solves this by providing: 
• A unified, mobile-first catalog of electronic products with real-time pricing, colors, 
sizes, and delivery options. 
• Targeted promotions and flash deals to drive sales. 
• Seamless purchase flow (online payment or cash-on-delivery). 
• Admin dashboard for inventory and order management
